# Linking Research Software to Research Organizations

Goal of our efforts during this hackathon: surface a list of _possible links_ from software repositories to ROR IDs (the idea being that this would be followed by manual curations).

## Resources

Regex for grabbing GitHub repos from freetext: `(?i)github.com/([A-Za-z0-9-_.]+/[A-Za-z0-9-_.]*[A-Za-z0-9-_])`

This is a template repo for external hackathon projects. Please build your project off of this template:
1. Click the ‘use this template’ button above to create a new repository, and choose an appropriate name for your project. The suggested naming scheme is: `SoftwareImpactHackathon2023_PROJECT`.
2. Turn on basic [security features](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/github-security-features) for your repository under Settings -> Security and Analysis. We strongly recommend you enable at least [Private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository), [Dependabot security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates) and [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-repositories).
4. Add your project link and description to the list of hackathon projects we’re curating at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-impact-hackathon-2023 , by making a pull request to that repo.
5. Add your name or an appropriate copyright owner to the LICENSE file. CZI will not own the code in your repository.
6. [Grant privileges](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)  to other collaborators, if desired.
7. Replace this section of the readme and the above "Hackathon-Template" heading with an appropriate readme and title for your project.

*Please do not modify or delete any other part of the readme below this line.*

## RRID to ROR Software Mapping Data File Readme Section

This is a file that has been extracted from the SciCrunch Registry, accessible on the web: [https://scicrunch.org/resources](https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/source/nlx_144509-1/search)

The data is human curated and filtered by "Software" additional resource type. 
These data are openly available and any resource can be freely accessed by using the scicrunch or another resolving service without an API key (be kind with the number of times you access this or be banned). Example: 
https://scicrunch.org/resolver/[RRID] for bots add .json at the end




The data contains the columns described below:

|--- |---|---|
|	scr_id	|	scicrunch registry identifier can be used to pull metadata via n2t.net/RRID:SCR_$###	|	text	|
