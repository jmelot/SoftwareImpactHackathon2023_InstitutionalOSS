# Help us link software to contributor organizations!

We're excited that you are thinking of contributing to our project. Here are some starting points:

## How to get help

If you would like to use our work but have questions or encounter problems, please open an issue. Letting us know something is confusing or isn't working is very valuable feedback and we appreciate you taking the time to write it up!

## How to contribute to this project

Thank you for even considering making a contribution! There are several ways to contribute:

### Contributing code

If you would like to take on an existing issue, please comment on that issue to let us know. We will assign it to you and help answer any questions
you might have along the way. We've labeled some beginner-friendly issues with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/jmelot/SoftwareImpactHackathon2023_InstitutionalOSS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
If you would like to propose a code change that isn't captured by an existing issue, please open an issue to start a discussion first.

To submit code changes, please fork this repository and create a branch named `<issue number>-<2-4 word description>`. Create a pull request when your changes are ready
and a member of the team will review your work.

### Contributing analysis

We need help analyzing the results of our current data, both to detect errors in our linking methods and to generally better understand our data. If you are interested in 
contributing analysis, open an issue to start a discussion, or comment on [existing issues labeled `analysis`](https://github.com/jmelot/SoftwareImpactHackathon2023_InstitutionalOSS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aanalysis) if they are relevant to your interests. 

The most valuable analytic contributions are good ideas or clean script submissions that can be easily rerun on updated data by other members of the team. Please follow the workflow
described above in `Contributing code` to submit analytic scripts. 

### Other ways to contribute

One non-code contribution we would greatly appreciate is more evaluation data - that is, human-curated links between software and the organizations of contributors to this software.
If you have a source of such data, we would be eager to work with you to use it to evaluate our tools. Please open an issue to discuss your dataset. If you do not have an existing 
dataset in place but are able to help manually curate data, please comment on this issue to discuss further.

Other great non-code contributions include editing our documentation to make it more user-friendly and helping connect us to potential users or collaborators.
